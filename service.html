        <h1>Black coffee</h1>
        <p>Although I like my morning coffee with a generous pour of half-and-half, I appreciate
          black coffee and admire those who enjoy drinking it straight. Black coffee is a widely
          consumed beverage around the world. Of course, it also serves as the base for many 
          coffee-based drinks. Although black coffee is low in calories, it contains caffeine
          and some nutrients. It may even offer a variety of health benefits.</p>

        <h1>Cold Brew coffee</h1>
        <p>Cold brew coffee is created by steeping coarsely ground coffee in cool or room 
          temperature water for an extended period, often 12 hours or more. By using cooler
          temperatures and longer brewing times, the final product is a type of coffee drink
          with a smooth concentrate that can be diluted with water or milk depending on your
          preference. Some baristas also choose to add flavoring syrups to cold brews for 
          lighter drink options.</p>

        <h1>Irish Coffee</h1>
        <p>One of the most popular drinks in Ireland is undoubtedly Irish coffee. This
          hot beverage is made with coffee, whiskey, and cream, and it is usually served
          with a spoonful of sugar to balance out the drink's bitterness. While there are 
          many variations of this type of coffee drink, all of those said variations are
          sure to warm you up on a cold day.</p>

        <h1>Black tea</h1>
        <p>Black tea is made from the leaves of a bush called Camellia sinensis. It has
          caffeine as well as other stimulants and antioxidants. Lots of people in the 
          U.S. drink it either hot or cold. It should always be steeped in hot water 
          before it is cooled. A process called oxidation turns the leaves from green 
          to a dark brownish-black color. Oxidation means the leaves are exposed to 
          moist, oxygen-rich air.</p>

          bleeding and heal wounds, aid digestion, improve heart and mental health, 
          and regulate body temperature. Studies suggest that green tea may have 
          positive effects on weight loss, liver disorders, type 2 diabetes, 
          Alzheimer's disease, and more.</p>

        <h1>Herbal tea</h1>
        <p>Herbal teas, sometimes called tisanes, are very similar to white teas,
          but they contain a blend of herbs, spices, fruits, or other plants in 
          addition to tea leaves. Herbal teas don't contain caffeine, which is
          why they're known for their calming properties.</p>

        <h1>White tea</h1>
        <p>White tea may also be good for your teeth since it contains a high source
          of fluoride, catechins, and tannins that can strengthen teeth, fight plaque,
          and make them more resistant to acid and sugar. Research shows it may be the
          most effective tea in fighting various forms of cancer thanks to its high 
          level of antioxidants.</p>
